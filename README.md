# MAX30102 Heart Rate and SpO2 Monitor with OLED Display

This Arduino code reads heart rate and SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) data from a MAX30102 sensor and displays the results on an OLED display.

## Hardware

* Arduino Uno or compatible board
* MAX30102 sensor module
* OLED display module (compatible with OakOLED library)

## Software

* Arduino IDE ([https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/))
* OakOLED library ([https://www.tronixstuff.com/oakoled-oled-display-module-library-for-arduino/](https://www.tronixstuff.com/oakoled-oled-display-module-library-for-arduino/))
* DFRobot_MAX30102 library ([https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_MAX30102](https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_MAX30102))
* Adafruit_GFX library ([https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library))
* Adafruit_SSD1306 library ([https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-SSD1306-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-SSD1306-Library))

## Instructions

1. Install the required libraries into your Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the MAX30102 sensor and OLED display to your Arduino board according to their respective datasheets and library documentation.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
4. The heart rate and SpO2 values will be printed to the serial monitor and displayed on the OLED screen.

## Notes

* This code is provided for educational purposes only and may not be suitable for medical applications.
* The accuracy of the readings depends on the sensor and placement on the body.
* You may need to adjust the delay in the `loop` function depending on your desired update rate.
* Adjust the pin connections and OLED library settings as needed for your specific hardware.
